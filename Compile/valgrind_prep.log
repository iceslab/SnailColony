==8431== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably

==8431== 
==8431== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==8431==   /path/to/gdb ./SnailColony
==8431== and then give GDB the following command
==8431==   target remote | /usr/lib64/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=8431
==8431== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
